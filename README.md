## üß† Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flash MicroPython
Install the latest MicroPython firmware for your ESP32 or ESP32-S3 using [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) or `esptool.py`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Required Files
Upload both of these files to your ESP device:
boot.py &
ota.py

You can use **Thonny**, **ampy**, or **WebREPL** to transfer these files.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Wi-Fi  
Edit the following section in your `boot.py` file before uploading:  
```python
SSID = "Your_WiFi_SSID"
PASSWORD = "Your_WiFi_Password"
```

### üí° Replace the SSID and PASSWORD with your local Wi-Fi credentials.
Once uploaded.

Your Thonny console will show something like:
Wi-Fi: STA IP: 192.168.1.14
HTTP server on 192.168.1.14 port 80

Use this IP address in your browser to access the Web IDE.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Change Login Credentials

Open ota.py in Thonny and locate:
```python
USER = "admin"
PASSWORD = "admin"
```

Change both fields to your desired username and password, then re-upload ota.py.
This secures your OTA Web IDE against unauthorized access.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Getting IP from Thonny IDE

After saving both files and restarting the ESP32:
	1.	Open Thonny IDE.
	2.	Connect to your ESP32 via MicroPython (USB).
	3.	Watch the Shell/console output ‚Äî it will display your board‚Äôs assigned IP address.
	4.	Copy that IP and open it in Chrome/Brave/Firefox/anyotherbrower:
     http://<your-device-ip>

### üßë‚Äçüíª Using the Web Interface
	1.	Connect your ESP32 to the same Wi-Fi network.
	2.	Open the IP shown in Thonny (http://192.168.x.x).
	3.	Enter your login credentials.
	4.	Write or paste your MicroPython script.
	5.	Click Save & Run to execute immediately.
